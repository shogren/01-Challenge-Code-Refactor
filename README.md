# 01-Challenge-Code-Refactor Project

## Description

This is the module 01 "code refactor project" by Jonathan Shogren. The challange here was to refactor a website to make it more accessable
and easier to read.

Here is a link to the live finished page: https://shogren.github.io/01-Challenge-Code-Refactor/

## User Story

> AS A marketing agency
>
> I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
>
> SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Additional Notes

* In order to add alt text to the background image, I either could have moved the image out of css and into the html, or find an alternate method of adding the text. I found [this site](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html) which described how to add the alt text using an `aria-label`.

* I erred on the side of too many comments in the css and html, so there are descriptions for each element and each css entry which feels like overkill.

* This was a fun project, I enjoyed it!
